# NFT_Analysis

This is a data science focused project which aims to make analysis of the NFT market place easier, especially for
the new-comers to the field of NFT and investing in NFT.

The aim of the code has been to minimize modularity while keeping the code clean and understandable to the developer.

Currently the python and the JavaScript used are in the single HTML page.

We have used the moonstream database for the edges and nodes representation.

The code will not directly run on Github pages, so if you wish to run the code, I suggest you copy it and run on your
offline compiler and for faster compilation, you can use online compiler to see the results of the code such as codepen.io

Feel free to use the code for your projects!
